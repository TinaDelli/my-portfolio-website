                    <h3>Rogue Pickings Website</h3>
                    <h4>HTML &amp; CSS from Photoshop Design Comp </h4>
                    <p>Having the newfound skills to look at a photoshop image of a website, extract the images and put together a website from scratch using HTML &amp; CSS and the extracted images I put my knowledge to practice to build a faux website for a healthy eatery option.
                    I was able to extract the images and put together a website a client wanted based off the image, display their menu and contact information and tell a bit about them.</p>

                    <h4>HTML5 &amp; CSS Website</h4>
                    <p>This was the first project that tested my HTML and CSS skills. I was able to put together a faux portfolio for a client that showcased their web development skills and contact information and it was when I realized this brought me Jubilee (no pun intended)!</p>

                    <h4>HTML5, CSS, &amp; JavaScript Exercise</h4>
                    <p>This is one of the first moments I had with JavaScript and the most rewarding of my first memoirs as a beginner dev. I got to tango with JavaScript and make a working lolCat clock! This was the first tango where I got to display my JavaScript skills and I realized that coding would be my new dance parter for life!</p>

                    <h3>I am passionate about the web.</h3>
                    <p>I am a wife, mother of two beautiful girls and a New York native! I am also an avid Disney fan, even having an  amazing chance to work with the Mouse for about 4 years! I love to travel! So far I have been to Florida, Georgia, California, Jamaica, Beijing, Shanghai, Hong Kong, Seoul, Busan, Jeju Island and of course New York! I speak a little Korean, having taught myself when I was 14, and a little Chinese from the few months I spent in China. I love learning languages so learning computer languages feels like second nature to me. I am also learning Web Development and Design fundamentals through this awesome site called Skillcrush. In my free time you can find me with my girls, singing, writing, learning to play the guitar, playing video games or practicing my new found coding skills!</p>
                    <p>Can't wait to work with you!</p>
